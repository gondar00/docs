  <Accordion title="Keep messages concise and actionable">
    Especially for SMS and WhatsApp, keep your messages short and include a clear call-to-action. Members should immediately understand what you want them to do.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalize whenever possible">
    Use dynamic fields to personalize messages with member names, class preferences, and visit history. Personalized messages have significantly higher engagement rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test before launching">
    Always send test messages to yourself and your team before launching a campaign. Check for typos, broken links, and proper variable substitution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect timing and frequency">
    Don't send messages too early or too late in the day. Also, be mindful of message frequency to avoid overwhelming your members.
