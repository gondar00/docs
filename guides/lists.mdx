# Lists

The Contacts section is managed through **Lists**, which are used to segment your audience for targeted campaigns and automations.

## List Types

Stretch AI supports four types of lists for flexible audience management:

| List Type | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic** | Automatically updates based on specific criteria (e.g., "Last Visit Date is more than 90 days ago"). | Creating highly targeted segments for re-engagement campaigns. |
| **Static** | A fixed list of contacts, typically imported from a CSV file. | Importing a one-time list of leads from an external source. |
| **Form Responses** | Automatically populated by submissions from a specific form created in the Form Builder. | Targeting users who filled out a specific lead generation form. |
| **WhatsApp Tags** | Populated based on tags applied to contacts within the Conversations feature. | Segmenting users based on their interaction history in WhatsApp. |

## List Management Features

- **Segmentation**: Dynamic lists allow complex, multi-condition segmentation using various contact properties.
