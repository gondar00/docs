The Campaigns section is where you execute targeted marketing efforts across Email, SMS, and WhatsApp.

## Campaign Creation Workflow

The **Create New Campaign** modal guides users through the essential settings:

1. **Recipients**: Select the target audience using a **List** (Static, Dynamic, etc.).
2. **Template**: Select the pre-designed message template (Email, SMS, or WhatsApp).
3. **Frequency**: Define the campaign type:
   - **Send one time**: For immediate or scheduled one-off broadcasts.
   - **Recurring schedule**: For campaigns that run automatically at set intervals.

> **Note**: For details on creating and managing recipient lists, see the **Contacts** documentation. For creating message content, see the **Templates** documentation.
