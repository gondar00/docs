The Automations feature allows you to build powerful, multi-step marketing workflows that run automatically based on specific triggers.

## Automations Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your active and disabled automations.

- **Filtering**: Automations can be filtered by **Category** (e.g., Email, SMS, WhatsApp) and **Status** (Active Only, Disabled Only).
- **Management**: Users can manage categories, export data, and access settings.

## Automation Structure

Automations are built using a sequence of:

1. **Triggers**: The event that starts the automation (e.g., Form Submission, Mindbody Event, Contact Added to List).
2. **Actions**: The steps the automation takes (e.g., Send Email, Send SMS, Add to List, Apply Tag).
3. **Conditions/Delays**: Logic to control the flow (e.g., Wait 24 hours, Check if contact has a specific tag).
