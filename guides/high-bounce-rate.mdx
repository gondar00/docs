# Why is My Bounce Rate So High?

A high bounce rate means your WhatsApp messages aren't being delivered to recipients. This guide helps you identify the root causes and provides actionable solutions to improve your message delivery rates.

## Understanding Bounce Rates

**Bounce Rate** is the percentage of messages that fail to be delivered to recipients. A healthy bounce rate is typically below 5%. If your bounce rate is higher, it indicates issues with your messaging strategy, contact data quality, or WhatsApp policy compliance.

<Warning>
**High bounce rates can lead to:**
- Wasted messaging costs
- Reduced sender reputation
- Account restrictions or suspension
- Lower campaign ROI
- Poor customer experience
</Warning>

## Common Causes of High Bounce Rates

### Category 2: Policy and Compliance Errors

These errors occur when messages violate WhatsApp's business policies.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Meta Chose Not to Deliver">
    **Error Code**: `131051`
    
    **Error Message**: "Meta chose not to deliver your message"
    
    **Cause**: WhatsApp's quality filters determined the message shouldn't be delivered, often due to:
    - Low engagement rates from this sender
    - User marked previous messages as spam
    - Per-user marketing limit reached
    - Content quality concerns
    
    **Solutions**:
    - **Improve message quality**: Make content more relevant and valuable
    - **Segment better**: Target only highly engaged users
    - **Reduce frequency**: Don't over-message the same users
    - **Use utility messages**: For transactional content, use utility templates instead of marketing
    - **Monitor engagement**: Track read rates and responses
    
    **Prevention**:
    - Build engagement gradually with new contacts
    - Send personalized, relevant content
    - Respect per-user marketing limits

    - Maintain high read and response rates

  <Tab title="Spam or Policy Violation">
    **Error Code**: `131026` or `131008`
    
    **Error Message**: "Message failed due to spam or policy violation"
    
    **Cause**: Message content violates WhatsApp's Business Policy or Commerce Policy.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Review WhatsApp's Business Policy thoroughly
    - Remove prohibited content (misleading claims, adult content, etc.)
    - Ensure you have proper opt-in consent
    - Use approved message templates only
    - Don't send unsolicited marketing messages
    
    **Prevention**:

    - Use clear, honest messaging
    - Follow template approval guidelines
    - Regularly review policy updates
    - Train team on compliance requirements
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Template Not Approved">
    **Error Code**: `132000`
    
    **Error Message**: "Template status is not approved"

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Per-User Marketing Limit">
    **Error Code**: `131053`
    
    **Error Message**: "Per-user marketing template message limit reached"
    
    **Cause**: The recipient has reached their limit for marketing messages from all businesses in a given timeframe.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - **Wait and retry**: Try sending to these users later
    - **Use utility messages**: If the content is transactional, use utility templates
    - **Segment by engagement**: Prioritize highly engaged users who are less likely to hit limits
    - **Reduce marketing frequency**: Space out marketing campaigns
    
    **Prevention**:
    - Focus on quality over quantity
    - Send to engaged users first
    - Use utility templates for transactional content
    - Monitor delivery rates by user segment
    - Implement smart sending schedules
    
    **Understanding the Limit**:
    WhatsApp limits marketing messages per user to prevent inbox overload. Factors include:
    - Number of marketing messages user received from any business
    - User's inbox activity
    - User's recent engagement with marketing messages
    
    This ensures your messages reach users who are most likely to engage.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: The best way to maintain low bounce rates is to focus on quality over quantity. A smaller, highly engaged list will always outperform a large, low-quality list in terms of deliverability, engagement, and ROI.
