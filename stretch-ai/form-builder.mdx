# Form Builder

The Form Builder allows you to create custom forms for data collection, which can then be used to populate contact lists and trigger automations.

## Forms Management

The main view lists all your created forms.

- **Actions**: Refresh, Add Form, Search forms.
- **Empty State**: If no forms exist, a **Create First Form** button is displayed.

## Integration with Automations and Contacts

Forms are a critical component of the Stretch AI ecosystem:

- **Contacts**: Form submissions automatically populate a **Form Responses** list, which can be used as a recipient list for campaigns.
- **Automations**: Form submission is a primary **Trigger** for automated workflows, allowing for instant follow-up and lead nurturing.
