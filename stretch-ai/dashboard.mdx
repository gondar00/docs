# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard provides a centralized view of your marketing performance, focusing on key metrics for both campaigns and automations.

## Business Performance Summary

This section offers a high-level financial overview:

-   **Total Revenue**: The total revenue generated by the business within the selected time frame.
-   **Attributed Revenue**: Revenue directly linked to the performance of active campaigns and automations, providing a clear measure of marketing ROI.

The dashboard also features tables for the **Top 5 Automations by Revenue** and **Top 5 Campaigns by Revenue** for quick performance identification.

## Campaign Metrics Dashboard

This section visualizes performance data across all communication channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp).

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Channel Performance** | Total volume of messages sent across Email, SMS, and WhatsApp. |
| **Engagement Performance** | Percentage of delivered messages that were clicked and opened (for Email) or simply delivered/read (for SMS/WhatsApp). |
| **Revenue Performance** | Revenue generated from users who clicked on campaigns. |

Users can adjust the reporting period using the date range selector (e.g., "Last 180 days") and export the data for external analysis.
