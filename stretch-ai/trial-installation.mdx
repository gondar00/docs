# Trial/Installation

The initial setup of your Stretch AI account is streamlined to get you started quickly.

## Trial Period

Information regarding the length and features included in your trial period will be provided upon account creation. During the trial, you will have access to the core features necessary to test the platform's capabilities, including:

-   Access to the **Dashboard** and analytics.
-   Ability to create **Lists** and **Templates**.
-   Ability to explore the **Automations** library.
-   Access to the **Integrations** section to begin connecting your external services.

## Installation Process

As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, the "installation" process is primarily focused on account setup and integration configuration.

1.  **Account Provisioning**: Your account is provisioned on the Stretch AI cloud infrastructure.
2.  **Secure Login**: Use the secure, OTP-based login process to access the application.
3.  **Integration Setup**: The most critical step is configuring the necessary integrations (Mindbody, WhatsApp, Meta Ads) to synchronize your data and enable multi-channel communication.

> **Next Steps**: Proceed to the **Onboarding and Integrations** guide to begin connecting your business systems.
